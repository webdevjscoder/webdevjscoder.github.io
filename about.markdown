Juan Cobian is like an other ordinary person in this world, hard-working, dedicated,
and willing to learn. As a child, Juan grow up with two brothers and two sisters (as you can
imagine,
life wasn't the easiest). He always dreamed of becoming a lot of things in this world, but like
most,
he decided on a different path.

He is currently an unknown Construction Worker with a positive
attitude towards anything that crosses his path. He hasn't always been a Construction Worker,
previously
to working in this area, Juan was an independent Online Sells Rep. He worked a lot with new
technology
and even learn to repair computers.

Learning to repair computer and other electronic devices helped him
develop skills in areas he would have never imagined possible. Now, working as a Construction Worker
he
is also establishing himself as a "Unicorn," learning to do more than just sell and repair
computers.
He has experience to sell, repair, or even construct his way out of any issue that may arise in his
way.
