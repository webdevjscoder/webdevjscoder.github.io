CLI Project Week!...Wow! Was this ever a great experience of success and failure all bunched in one (phew). I cannot
be more grateful I was able to get through it in one piece. I did learn a lot throughout this week though, whether it was
from my personal experience or through cohort classmates. Regardless, I've learned so much in the span
of a week and I am very proud of myself that I was able to get it done. Teaching others how to get the project started
or even debugging there code was such an eye opener and I couldn't be more grateful that my classmates felt they could
reach out to me to ask questions. They helped me grow not only as a person, but also a Software Engineer because that's
what I am! A Software Engineer...how good it feels to finally say that and not feel like a complete imposter, not that
I was but sometimes I had my moments. With this being said the process for this project was such a roller-coaster
sometimes I felt I completely understood everything and nothing at the same time. Getting my project started was simple
then scraping was also simple but getting to that second level of scraping was were everything starting kicking in. Were
I felt everything I thought I knew went out the window and I felt I was lost, but with the help of Aysan I was able to
get the understanding down and I really give her a lot of the credit as to why my project was able to get completed. The
staff was such a great help for me and I can say the same for a lot of my classmates, we couldn't be more grateful to
have them. As far as my thinking process coming into this project, it was to get at least one thing done per day...by this
I mean I wanted to have the scraping done one day, my cli class another, and so on. Of course it didn't go as planned
as always in this line of work, I got the scraping done but it wasn't as smooth as I wanted and I figured out as I was
going I have to switch websites because either the website had a horrible structure to it refered to as the DOM or it wasn't
letting me get the information I needed. So this whole process I switched websites three times to find the right one. Once
I did find the right one I was golden, scraping was a breeze, setting up my CLI was also a breeze. Getting those two things
done pretty much had my project running exactly how I wanted until, how I mentioned about, I hit the second level of
scraping. Here is where I took a day or two trying to figure it out on my own and this was very painful. So if I have
and information to give out about this process, it's make sure to ask questions if you don't understand a certain thing,
in this case for me it was second level scraping. As soon I asked and got help I was able to breeze this too, all it took
was asking a question to a cohort lead...That's all. So to conclude this post, I just wanna say one thing...code on!
Don't give up if you are stuck ask for help and if you got a hand on it, help others in need.
