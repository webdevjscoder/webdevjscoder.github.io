Starting this section of the curriculum was not a complete foreign concept to me since I've somewhat meddled with
databases before. Don't get me wrong I never completely got into databases to be able to say that I am an expert in this
field, but I am no strange to them either. Making SQL request was such an eye opener and completely upped my developing
skills to a new level. Also not to say I am a professional developer...on the contrary this experience has shown me that
I, as a software engineer have much to learn. I have barely come to scrape the top of the iceberg and I couldn't be more
thrilled to continue my journey. Working with SQLite3 was such a great experience to able to learn the functions of a
real database, but I can't wait to actually work with more advanced database software. Now I don't believe I can build a
site from the ground up without hesitation but I will say I am quite confident that I can definitely get it up and running
without a hitch. Sinatra itself was quite new to me, I had never heard it so getting into it did take a minute to get the
hang of, but at last with practice and lots of hours studying it became a addition to my arsenal.

Learning about routes was also a fairly new concept to me although I might say I feel like I've worked with them before
but I can't put my finger on it as to why I believe that? I guess I'll never know, but anyhow back to Sinatra and routes.
I learned about the 5 HTTP verbs and 7 RESTful routes, which I have also heard of before but this solidified my basic
understanding. The 5 HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE. The 7 RESTful routes are Index, New, Show, Update
(for PATCH), Update (for PUT), Create, and DELETE. These are also known as the Conventional routes because as
developers this is the pattern we follow for every site we ever create. We Create, Read, Update, and Delete...CRUD is
always used when developing a website. It's funny because come to think of it, developing always seemed so amazing but
I always imagined it being so difficult, but now that I am more experienced I seem that it's all just a simple pattern.
Once we develop the skills for this, there is no limit as to what we can accomplish...even more so as a team. Which I am
very excited to experience one day.

To end this blog, I will give a brief review to my Sinatra Project Week experience, and I'll start by saying this was so
invigorating. Leaving my computer to end the day to get rest for a new day was such a difficult task, justing itching to
continue coding my site. In the end, I did see myself to the bedroom to get some rest and continue the following day.
But my whole experience was as smooth as I had hoped, the original idea for my project didn't come to form as I ran it
quite a few bumps, but none bigger than not being able to incorporate nokogiri into my project. Thinking it was a great
idea I decided to try scraping a multi-million dollar site (Nfl.com). Come to my surprise I was getting throttled, each
time I tried rendering the information I wanted. Spending all of two days thinking that it was just scraping method that
was failing but I was very wrong. Nonetheless I was able to move and continue with project, at this point I had to just
settle with dummy data for my site and hoped that even with simple data I would be able to get my point across, which I
believe I did and I am proud of my project.
