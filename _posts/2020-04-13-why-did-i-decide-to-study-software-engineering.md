Becoming a Software Engineer...Why did I decide to study Software Engineering? The answer isn't as simple as 
the eye meets, coming to this decision wasn't solely based off the love of code, I had a major influence alone 
the way. As funny or unconvincing as it might seem I have always had a love for what one would call "code", whether, 
watching movies or television shows that would have a hacker creating an algorithm (Matrix, Nikita, Criminal Minds, 
or Arrow). The love has always been there, now I know you might have chuckled a bit at the idea that thinking code 
was anything like in the movies or shows, but honestly that's what I believed was coding, now some of it may be 
realist but the process is nothing like it in real life. Coming face to face with code the first time was nothing 
shy of a big blur, it was though like I was looking at gibberish being used to create these amazing sites one could 
stare at for days on end. As astonish as I was, and confused...that didn't affect what my mind was set to accomplish 
and that was learn to code. Having seen this made me want to understand it so much more, this where my very good 
friend introduced (name should not be mentioned) me the lime light that was programming. 

This mentor of mine was nothing short of extraordinary, he grabbed me by hand and guided me the whole way through the 
process, yes he made me struggle from time to time, but now I know that was for my own good (at the time I thought he 
hated me) because, why make me go through this whole struggle to just see me fail? Little did I know, he was grooming 
me to become the best Software Engineer (he also told me to just step up and take the name "Software Engineer " and 
stick to it) he knew I could one day become. So the answer to your question why did I decide to study Software 
Engineering? All this was made happened by one man and one man only, who believed in me when no else even cared to 
acknowledge the fact that I can be greater in this life than just a simple construction worker or cashier at a grocery 
store (not that I was but you get the point). This man had a bigger picture for me and all my hard work and dedication 
to programming was thanks to him and for that I thank him. Now it's my turn to prove to him...especially myself he 
didn't make a mistake for believing in me, this course at FlatIron is another step to get me closer to that and much 
more.
