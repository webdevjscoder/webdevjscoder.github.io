Becoming a Software Engineer...Why did I decide to study Software Engineering? As funny or unconvincing as it might
seem I have always had a love for what one would call "code" whether it watching movies or television shows that would 
have a hacker creating an algorithm (Matrix, Nikita, Criminal Minds, or Arrow). The love has always been there, now I 
know you might have chuckled a bit at the idea that thinking code was anything like in the movies or shows, but 
honestly, that's what I believed was coding, now some of it may be realistic but the process is nothing like it in 
real life. 

It's a lot more stressful and confusing, especially if it's the first time gazing at it. Now, the answer was pretty 
simple, I loved what code was and what it did, being able to develop and create something people can look at and 
admire was something that brought joy to my face. Yet, coming to this decision of studying this "massive beast" 
(there is so much to learn and understand in this field) wasn't solely based on the love, joy, and excitement it 
brought me, I had a major influence along the way to help me get acquainted with my new friend of mine.

Coming face to face with code the first time was nothing shy of a big blur, it was though I was looking at gibberish 
being used to create these amazing sites one could stare at for days on end. As astonished as I was, and confused...
that didn't affect what my mind was set to accomplish and that was learning to code. Having seen this made me want to 
understand it so much more, this was when my very good friend introduced me to the limelight that was programming. 

This mentor of mine was nothing short of extraordinary, he grabbed me by hand and guided me the whole way through the 
process, yes he made me struggle from time to time, but now I know that was for the best, at the time I thought he 
hated me because, why make me go through this whole struggle to just see me fail? Little did I know, he was grooming me 
to become the best Software Engineer (he also told me to just step up and take the name "Software Engineer " and 
stick to it) he knew I could one day become. 

So the answer to your question why did I decide to study Software Engineering? All this was made happened by one man 
and one man only, who believed in me when most people around me questioned and laughed at the idea of me make 
programming my career, him acknowledging the fact that I can be greater in this life than anyone expected made me 
strive for this even more. This man had a bigger picture for me and all my hard work and dedication to programming was 
thanks to him and for that I thank him. Now it's my turn to prove to him...especially myself he didn't make a mistake 
for believing in me, this course at FlatIron is another step to get me closer to that and much more.
