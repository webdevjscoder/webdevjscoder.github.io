This is it guys, the last step, yes the LAST STEP before graduating and becoming a Software Engineer. Doesn't mean I've
reached the peak of my profession, but lets be quite honest, in this career there is no peak sort of speak. I mean you could say
that you reached the peak of a certain skill, if that's all that one worked at, right? But even then, there will always
be more whether its a new version, or whatever it may be. One never reaches the end of the learning curb it just keeps
growing and that it a great thing because who wouldn't want more knowledge in their tool belt? With that being said lets
get this started.

So about 5 months ago I began my journey to become a Software Engineer, I had no idea where to start. A good friend of mine
had been telling me about coding bootcamps and I should start there, but me being me, I would shrug off his advice simply
stating, "Yeah yeah I'll join one, but I want to give it a try on my own first." That went on for about year, I did get a
good grasp of the concepts that I was learning but they made no sense to me. The only things that made complete sense were
HTML and CSS is all honest. Yet, learning Javascript never really stuck, I didn't understand what it was doing or even
accomplishing, even though I was built small application. This was when I decided it was time to give this "Bootcamp" thing
a try.

Of course I mentioned it to this good friend of mine and, you guessed it, he began with I told you so's as well as the
"You would of been done already, if you started when I told you." Was he right? In my case he was, because I didn't hold
myself accountable for my work or the time I put into my work.

One of the big things about a Bootcamp is that they will hold you accountable for your time and work. This is huge because
there is no slacking off, and I say this because we as students get tasked with lessons for the month. Now you may think,
what's the big deal about that? I can do that myself. Yes you can, but like I mentioned WILL you hold yourself accountable
to finish these tasks within the time provided (3-4 weeks). After that, build an application from the knowledge one just 
obtained during the learning the period? I would say this is where it gets complicated if one is being self-taught because
in my case we were giving deliverables, as for a person being self-taught would have to come up with their own or just
build something to their liking I suppose.

Then we have the fortunate pleasure to have open office hours, this is we were go if I have any complications with 
either our assignments or projects. Of course we also have the great pleasure of asking a fellow cohort member about an 
issue we have and just into a quick zoom call to try and resolve our issues.

But that's not the main reason I decided to join Flatiron, this is in my opinion by far the biggest reason why. It is the
live lectures, I am a huge visual learner. I love to read up on a topic then see what I just learned explained to greater
depths in the form of a video. To me this puts two and two together making everything click for me. This is when I get that
'Ah ha' moment. that everyone seeks, there is nothing better than that feeling.

After my experience with this Bootcamp, will I redo it? Yes, I would redo it in a heartbeat and not even think about it.
I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience. Would I recommend it to a fellow friend or family member
who is interested in becoming a Software Engineer? Yes, but I the only advice I would give them would be to get familiar
with the basics of programming at least. There were so many classmates that left the program or couldn't continue because
they couldn't grasp the information. This is not because of the lack of experience but the passion for it, in all honesty
this career is not for everyone. The drive has to be there as well as the love and passion, because this is something you
will do for the rest of your life. For me, I can't wait to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in the programming
world. So with that, I say good luck to all of you that are considering Web Development as a career and hope to meet or
see you guys around!
