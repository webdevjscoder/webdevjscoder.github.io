Upon graduation from Flatiron School, I underestimated the level of difficulty it would be to find my first job. I began
sending out cold applications believing this would be the best approach. Was I ever wrong. What I once thought would be
an easy, fast process, turned out to be the longest and most difficult process I have ever been through. Turns out,
this is a job. Before I came to the conclusion that I need to begin networking a lot more than I have been.
I was riding the tide, expecting a job or even an interview to just land at my feet and not work for it. As I was applying
I was receiving rejection emails or worse I wouldn't hear anything at all. This lead me to begin doubting myself, which
lead to bad thoughts and ideas.

For months, I began to let myself go. I wasn't worried about networking, I wasn't working on side projects. I was doing
absolutely nothing. This was not because I didn't want to, but because I ran into the worst mindset someone in a new field
or new career can run into. Imposter syndrome.

For a very long time, I ignored this...more ignorance actually. The lack of not knowing what imposter syndrome really was
or ever having felt it. Once I experienced this thing called 'imposter syndrome' it didn't just present itself. It began
to completely break me apart. I began to feel like I wasn't good enough to be a software engineer, let alone be in this
field of work. For a while, I began to allow negative comments and thoughts to get into my head. This began to not only affect
my job search but also my work. There were days where I didn't feel like doing anything but just on my computer and stare.
I wasn't open my IDE to begin a project or even my browser to solve a problem on Leetcode. I just let myself go, this also
affected my personal life, I began to let my weight go.

After having enough, I finally decided to let my career coach know what was going on in my life and how I was feeling. He
didn't only support me, but he helped me completely change myself. He provided me with the emotional support that I needed
to find myself once more. He reassured me that I was more than good enough, that I did belong. I just needed to believe
it and everything would work out.

I asked him to challenge me, he asked, 'are you sure Juan? I have challenged you before and you didn't come through.' I
continued to tell him I needed this challenge to provide a fire under me. He did challenge me. He asked me to make a certain
amount of connection (interactions) with people on LinkedIn before our next meeting. But, before we got off the call he
said to me, 'Juan can I make a suggestion?' I answered, 'of course,' he asked me to watch a show on apple tv called 'Ted
Lasso.' I thought to myself yeah I can do that, on the bright side I've been meaning to watch anyways. He said, 'watch that
and let me know how you resonate with it', easy enough I thought.

The following week we meet up, he began to ask how I was doing. I answered I am doing great! He could see it in my facial
expressions that I was in a different environment. I was happy, motivated for the first time in a long time. I began to
mention that I was feeling uplifted, joyful. I also told him I had watched the tv show he mentioned, as well as how I resonated
with the show. It didn't exactly resonate with me, but I could see the point he was trying to get across. He was proud of
the progress I had made in just a week of working hard. I had completed the challenge he set out to me. There a line in the
show he asked me if I was remembered. I did not remember it at the time but he did repeat it to me. He said, 'do you remember
what Ted told Rebecca after his first day? Rebecca asked how much progress did you make today? He continued to respond with
I don't know what y'all's smallest unit of measurement is but that's how much I made.'

This is where it hit me. I didn't have to make a huge stride to accomplish my goals, it begins one small measurement
at a time. One step at a time began to be my motto. This lead me to finally get opportunities, begin to network
with others on LinkedIn. I believe this will continue to allow me to open doors that I didn't even existed. I am excelling in
my own skin and providing myself with confidence. This is all thanks to my amazing career coach, Adrian Trumbo. This doesn't
stop here I will continue to grow and become the best version of myself. I will continue to challenge myself and work hard.
I will continue to make my coach and myself proud!
